#WHAT IS GOOGLE DORK?
A Google Dork, also known as Google Dorking or Google hacking, is a valuable resource for hackers and hustlers.
For the average person, Google is just a search engine used to find text, images, videos, and news.
However, in the underground world, Google is a useful hacking tool.

Dorking is the practice of using Google to find vulnerable web applications and servers by using native Google search engine capabilities.
Unless webmasters block specific resources from their website using a robots.txt file, Google indexes all the information that is present on any website.


#GOOGLE DORK OPERATORS
Google’s search engine has its own built-in query language. The following list of queries can be run to find a list of files, find information about your competition, track people, get information about SEO backlinks, build email lists, and of course, discover web vulnerabilities.

Let’s look at the most popular Google Dorks and what they do.

cache: this dork will show you the cached version of any website, e.g. cache: ebay.com
allintext:  searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g. allintext: hacking tools
allintitle:  exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with C characters, e.g. allintitle:"Credit Cards"
allinurl:  it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g: allinurl: client area
filetype:  used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: filetype: jpg
inurl:  this is exactly the same as allinurl , but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g. inurl: admin
intitle:  used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, intitle:credit cards, will search for titles beginning with “Credit” but “Cards” can be somewhere else in the page.
inanchor:  this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g. inanchor:"credit cards"
intext:  useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text, e.g. intext:"credit cards"
link:  will show the list of web pages that have links to the specified URL, e.g. link: nike.com
site:  will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain, e.g. site:nike.com
*:  wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything”  before your word, e.g. how to * a website, will return “how to…” design/create/hack/card, etc… “a website”.
|:  this is a logical operator, e.g. "carding" "tips" will show all the sites which contain “carding” or “tips,” or both words.
+:  used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key, e.g. security + trails
–:  minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, e.g. carding -website will show pages that use “carding” in their text, but not those that have the word “website.”

#GOOGLE DORK EXAMPLES
Let’s take a look at some practical examples. You’ll be surprised how easy is to extract private information from any source just by using these Google hacking techniques.

#Log Files
 Error logs, access logs, and other types of application logs are often discovered inside the public HTTP space of websites. 
 This can help attackers find the PHP version you’re running, as well as the critical system path of your CMS or frameworks.
 
 For this kind of dork we can combine two Google operators, allintext and filetype, for example:
 allintext:username filetype:log
 
 This will show a lot of results that include username inside all *.log files.
 
 #Vulnerable Web Servers
 The following Google Dork can be used to detect vulnerable or hacked servers that allow appending 
 
 inurl:/proc/self/cwd
 
#Open FTP Servers
Google does not only index HTTP-based servers, it also indexes open FTP servers.

With the following dork, you’ll be able to explore public FTP servers, which can often reveal interesting things for the hustlers like you.

intitle:"index of" inurl:ftp

#ENV Files
.env files are the ones used by popular web development frameworks to declare general variables and configurations for local and online dev environments.
One of the recommended practices is to move these .env files to somewhere that isn’t publicly accessible. 
However, as you will see, there are a lot of devs who don’t care about this and insert their .env file in the main public website directory.

#SSH Private Keys
SSH private keys are used to decrypt information that is exchanged in the SSH protocol. As a general security rule, 
private keys must always remain on the system being used to access the remote SSH server, and shouldn’t be shared with anyone.

With the following dork, you’ll be able to find SSH private keys that were indexed by Google.
intitle:index.of id_rsa -id_rsa.pub
Let’s move on to another interesting SSH Dork.
If this isn’t your lucky day, and you’re using a Windows operating system with PUTTY SSH client, remember that this program always logs the usernames of your SSH connections.
In this case, we can use a simple dork to fetch SSH usernames from PUTTY logs:

filetype:log username putty

#Email Lists
It’s pretty easy to find email lists using Google Dorks. In the following example, we are going to fetch excel files that may contain a lot of email addresses.
filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"

We filtered to check out only the .edu domain names and found a popular university with around 1800 emails from students and teachers.
site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"

#Live Cameras
The following Google hacking techniques can help you fetch live camera web pages that are not restricted by IP.

Here’s the dork to fetch various IP based cameras:
inurl:top.htm inurl:currenttime

To find WebcamXP-based transmissions:
intitle:"webcamXP 5"

And another one for general live cameras:
inurl:"lvappl.htm"

There are a lot of live camera dorks that can let you watch any part of the world, live. 
You can find education, government, and even military cameras without IP restrictions.

#MP3, Movie, and PDF files
Nowadays almost no one downloads music after Spotify and Apple Music appeared on the market. However, 
if you’re one of those classic individuals who still download legal music, you can use this dork to find mp3 files:

intitle: index of mp3

The same applies to legal free media files or PDF documents you may need:
intitle: index of pdf
intext: .mp4

#weather
Google hacking techniques can be used to fetch any kind of information, and that includes many different types of electronic devices connected to the Internet.
In this case, we ran a dork that lets you fetch Weather Wing device transmissions. If you’re involved in meteorology stuff or merely curious, 
check this out:
intitle:"Weather Wing WS-2"
