WHAT IS GOOGLE DORK?
A Google Dork, also known as Google Dorking or Google hacking, is a valuable resource for hackers and hustlers.
For the average person, Google is just a search engine used to find text, images, videos, and news.
However, in the underground world, Google is a useful hacking tool.

Dorking is the practice of using Google to find vulnerable web applications and servers by using native Google search engine capabilities.
Unless webmasters block specific resources from their website using a robots.txt file, Google indexes all the information that is present on any website.


GOOGLE DORK OPERATORS
Google’s search engine has its own built-in query language. The following list of queries can be run to find a list of files, find information about your competition, track people, get information about SEO backlinks, build email lists, and of course, discover web vulnerabilities.

Let’s look at the most popular Google Dorks and what they do.

cache: this dork will show you the cached version of any website, e.g. cache: ebay.com
allintext:  searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g. allintext: hacking tools
allintitle:  exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with C characters, e.g. allintitle:"Credit Cards"
allinurl:  it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g: allinurl: client area
filetype:  used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: filetype: jpg
inurl:  this is exactly the same as allinurl , but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g. inurl: admin
intitle:  used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, intitle:credit cards, will search for titles beginning with “Credit” but “Cards” can be somewhere else in the page.
inanchor:  this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g. inanchor:"credit cards"
intext:  useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text, e.g. intext:"credit cards"
link:  will show the list of web pages that have links to the specified URL, e.g. link: nike.com
site:  will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain, e.g. site:nike.com
*:  wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything”  before your word, e.g. how to * a website, will return “how to…” design/create/hack/card, etc… “a website”.
|:  this is a logical operator, e.g. "carding" "tips" will show all the sites which contain “carding” or “tips,” or both words.
+:  used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key, e.g. security + trails
–:  minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, e.g. carding -website will show pages that use “carding” in their text, but not those that have the word “website.”
