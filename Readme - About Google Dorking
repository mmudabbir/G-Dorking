WHAT IS GOOGLE DORK?
A Google Dork, also known as Google Dorking or Google hacking, is a valuable resource for hackers and hustlers.
For the average person, Google is just a search engine used to find text, images, videos, and news.
However, in the underground world, Google is a useful hacking tool.

Dorking is the practice of using Google to find vulnerable web applications and servers by using native Google search engine capabilities.
Unless webmasters block specific resources from their website using a robots.txt file, Google indexes all the information that is present on any website.
